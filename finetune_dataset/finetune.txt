# Finetuning Process

1. You need a star file to have coordinates of proteins picked manually. Refer to finetune_dataset/sample.star and make your star file in the same format
2. Place all .mrc files inside finetune_dataset/mrc_files/ directory
3. Denoise all the .mrc files and they will be stored inside finetune_dataset/images/ directory
    Run: python utils/generate_jpg.py

4. Generate masks for images. Masks will be stored inside finetune_dataset/masks/ directory
    Run: python utils/generate_masks.py
    You need to input the diameter size of protein in pixel value.
